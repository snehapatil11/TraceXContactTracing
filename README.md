### Project Introduction
TraceX is a privacy-protected contact tracing application that can be utilized at any part of the world. In the first version of the application we have targeted the USA. The app is built with Android version 7 and above. TraceX helps to fight against the current pandemic situation by helping people to be aware of the circumstances. It is advisable to know about the people who are affected by any harmful contagious disease and take respective measures. 

TraceX does not intend to share any private information of the user. The app uses Bluetooth technology to share the advertising ID of the devices. In order to adhere to the privacy-policy, we use the BLE tokens generated by the mobile device. These tokens can’t be considered as private information because it keeps changing at certain periods of time. Hence, protects users to be tracked at any time. In case the user has been infected, we also take user’s consent by asking whether they would like to share their device data with TraceX to notify other people or not. TraceX then notifies other people who have been in their contact for more than 10 minutes within 6 feet of distance in the past 14 days.

TraceX also provides information from reliable sources through interactive graphs and numbers. The user can also maintain their health history by checking in to the app.

### Architecture of the project

The above Fig. 1 shows the architecture of our project. We are developing an android application. It includes the following components:

Bluetooth Beacon: This is one of the main components of the architecture. The mobile application uses Bluetooth beacons to broadcast their identifier to the nearby mobile devices within the 6 feet of distance.

Room Database: Room is the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library. It is used for persisting data locally and caches the relevant data from the main database. It also helps to store the Bluetooth beacon identifiers from various devices and maintain it for 7 days. 

Firebase: This is Google’s mobile platform. It is used for storing the user’s advertising IDs of past 7 days when the user reports he/she has been infected. A match will be done with all the exposed advertising IDs and a push notification will be sent to the users who have been in contact with them in the past.
